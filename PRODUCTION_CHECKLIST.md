# ðŸŸ¢ FastAPI Production-Readiness Checklist (Microservices)

This checklist covers all essential and advanced items to get your FastAPI microservices architecture ready for production.  
**Check off each item as you implement it in your project!**

---

## 1. Basic Service Design

- [âœ…] Service boundaries defined (one domain per service: users, products, orders, etc.)
- [âœ…] Async endpoints and database interactions
- [âœ…] Clean code structure: routers, services, schemas, models, exceptions, dependencies
- [âœ…] Business logic in service layer, not in routers

---

## 2. API Design & Security

- [ ] All endpoints documented (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Strong request/response validation (Pydantic models)
- [ ] Sensible HTTP status codes for all responses
- [ ] Proper use of response models (no leaking sensitive info)
- [ ] Rate limiting (e.g., [slowapi](https://pypi.org/project/slowapi/), API gateway)
- [ ] CORS securely configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (SSL/TLS)
- [âœ…] Authentication (JWT/OAuth2, external IdP, or internal)
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) and authorization checks
- [ ] Secure handling of user passwords (hashing, salting)
- [ ] Input sanitation (to prevent injection attacks)

---

## 3. Database & Persistence

- [ ] Each service uses its own database (database-per-service)
- [ ] Production-grade RDBMS (Postgres, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB, etc.)
- [ ] Async ORM (SQLAlchemy 2.x async, Tortoise ORM, etc.)
- [ ] Database migrations (Alembic, Tortoise-ORM migrations, etc.)
- [ ] Backups and recovery plan
- [ ] Connection pooling configured

---

## 4. Caching

- [ ] Redis or Memcached caching for hot data
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategies in place
- [ ] Use cache for rate limiting, session tokens, etc.
- [ ] Distributed cache if running multiple instances

---

## 5. Inter-Service Communication

- [ ] RESTful APIs for synchronous calls (OpenAPI schema shared)
- [ ] Async messaging for events (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams)
- [ ] Service discovery (Consul, DNS, etcd)
- [ ] Retry logic, timeouts, and circuit breakers for inter-service calls
- [ ] API Gateway in front of all services (Kong, Traefik, NGINX, custom FastAPI gateway, etc.)

---

## 6. Observability

- [ ] Structured logging (JSON) with context (request ID, user ID, etc.)
- [ ] Centralized log aggregation (ELK, Loki, CloudWatch, etc.)
- [ ] Metrics export (Prometheus, StatsD, etc.)
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin, etc.)
- [ ] Application health endpoints (`/healthz`, `/readyz`)
- [ ] Alerting and monitoring (Grafana, Alertmanager, etc.)

---

## 7. Error Handling & Resilience

- [ ] Custom exception classes for business/domain errors
- [ ] Global exception handlers for custom and generic errors
- [ ] HTTP error responses with clear messages, no stack traces
- [ ] Graceful shutdown support (SIGTERM handling)
- [ ] Automatic retries and exponential backoff for transient errors
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for 3rd party dependencies

---

## 8. Testing & Quality

- [ ] Unit tests for business logic (pytest, unittest)
- [ ] Integration tests for APIs and DB
- [ ] Test coverage reports
- [ ] Contract tests for inter-service APIs
- [ ] Load and stress testing (Locust, k6, etc.)
- [ ] Security testing (OWASP ZAP, etc.)

---

## 9. Deployment & Operations

- [ ] Dockerized (multi-stage builds, .dockerignore)
- [ ] Kubernetes (K8s) manifests/Helm charts for deployment
- [ ] Readiness/liveness probes in K8s
- [ ] Horizontal and vertical scaling policies set
- [ ] Blue/green or canary deployments
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- [ ] Auto-rollback on deployment failure
- [ ] Database migrations automated in CI/CD

---

## 10. Secrets & Configuration

- [ ] No secrets in code or in images
- [ ] Use secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, K8s secrets)
- [ ] 12-factor config: environment variables or config files
- [ ] Separate config per environment (dev, staging, prod)

---

## 11. Documentation & Developer Experience

- [ ] README for each service with setup, usage, and troubleshooting
- [ ] API documentation auto-generated (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Postman collections or sample curl commands
- [ ] Onboarding guide for new developers
- [ ] Architecture diagrams

---

## 12. Advanced Patterns (as needed)

- [ ] CQRS or Event Sourcing for complex domains
- [ ] Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- [ ] Feature flags for safe deployments
- [ ] Custom middleware for request/response logging, APM, etc.

---

## 13. Compliance, Privacy, and Governance

- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance as required
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive actions
- [ ] Data retention and deletion policies

---

## 14. Cost and Performance

- [ ] Cost monitoring (cloud, infra, DB, cache)
- [ ] Performance profiling and tuning

---

**Tip:**  
Copy this checklist into your main repo as `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` and revisit it regularly as you scale your microservices!
